            <blockquote>Impact Ideathon was recommended to me by another technology organization. I was curious about it and when I saw the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, I was really excited. I decided to register and I was impressed that communication was organized through Slack instead of emails and texts. I was able to meet and connect with multiple smart students my age! I finally felt like I had a support group. The events were well organized and I was very inspired by the speakers’ presentations and life stories. Being my first hackathon, I had no clue where to begin but I was provided numerous resources that I was able to use to design my project. Moreover, we were provided useful workshops with extremely talented and diligent software engineers in the most elite educational institutes and companies. My first hackathon experience was amazing and I am grateful United Engineers and STEMchats were able to help me in each way possible.</blockquote>

All of the organizers were extremely nice and accommodating, and I could tell that the planning and execution of the event was done very meticulously. They were very encouraging and the environment they have created allowed everyone to interact freely, learn, and have fun! Even though I attended in another country, which meant all-nighters and waking up early, I would love to do it all over again!</blockquote>

            <blockquote>Coming into this Ideathon, I was rather anxious as I barely knew anything about conceptualizing projects such as these– I didn’t know how to code extensive programs, nor did I have thorough knowledge on engineering. However, through this event and its workshops, I was able to learn more about various programs, as well as valuable skills, that were able to help me and my team fully develop our idea. This Ideathon was definitely a great learning experience! I can truly say that I learned a lot, not only regarding project planning but also regarding teamwork and coordination. I would certainly participate in one again!</blockquote>

Diseases will be deadlier than ever. The Impact Ideathon is hopefully the first of many Virtual Design Thinking Challenges hosted by United Engineers and STEMchats. <b>The Impact Ideathon is a competition for students ages 16-18 who will collaborate to identify the world's greatest sustainable development challenges and propose solutions that will shape our future.</b> Throughout this Ideathon, teams will select an idea to develop, justify, and present as a solution in response to a problem. Projects can take the form of computer programs, 3D models, graphic designs, pure academic research, or any other medium which can be tested and innovated upon. Participants will use design thinking and the engineering design process to evolve their solution to something that can be implemented.</p>
                    <p class = "main-txt">Students do not need to have any prior experience in order to participate. They should just be willing to learn and take advantage of the workshops and speakers that will be offered. <b>We will have workshops, keynote sessions, and guest speakers on machine learning, 3D modeling, graphic design, web development, the sciences, pitching and presentation, and more!</b> Through this Challenge, students will gain critical skills in teamwork, design thinking, and presentation as well as opportunities to network with leaders in the the social impact space as they relate to  the STEM fields. We hope that participants will continue to advance their projects after the Challenge so that their solution may become accessible to the public for the good of all.</p>

In addition, you will need to access Zoom for video conferencing, Slack for daily communication with your team and United Engineers, and an email address to an inbox that you check frequently. You might also want to use a Google Account in order to store and collaborate on project files with your team online. The Impact Ideathon is hosted virtually using Slack and Zoom, but events will be based on the Eastern Standard Time Zone (USA and Canada).</div>

                                <div class="card-body">Welcome! Impact Ideathon is similar to hackathons and makeathons, except you only need the ability to think and the will to problem solve in response to a challenge. Like any competition, there are rules, forms, prompts, judging, and prizes. Everyone first registers individually. Because this Ideathon requires participants to work in teams of 2-4, you will eventually need to find other registered participants to work with you on the challenge. However, teams will not be final until February 13. Whether or not you have a team, you will be able to meet and work with people by joining the Slack workspace.</div>
                                <div class="card-body">On February 13, everyone will attend an Opening Ceremony where the United Engineers will present more details on United Engineers, STEMchats, the Impact Ideathon challenge, team registration, and more. A guest speaker will address attendees to kick off the start of the challenge, offer good luck, and serve as inspiration. After the Opening Ceremony, participants will submit final team information. If participants do not have a team, they will be assigned on a team with similar interests.</div>
                                <div class="card-body">Teams will have time from February 13 10:00 PM EST to February 15 12:00 PM EST to decide on the prompt they will address, do research, and develop a solution that addresses problems mentioned in the prompt using a variety of media. Teams may choose to write computer code, conduct academic research and compile an insightful paper, create 3D models and prototypes of a tangible solution, design graphics to raise awareness, and more! Because this is an Ideathon, the projects are not limited to a single common subject.</div>
                                <div class="card-body">Despite this variety in projects, all teams will be judged on common criteria. In addition, all teams must submit project files in support of a final presentation by 12:00 PM EST on Monday, February 15 for their entries to be eligible. All teams must prepare a 5-7 minute presentation they will share with a panel of judges on Monday, February 15 during a designated time slot.</div>
                                <div class="card-body">After all of the teams have been evaluated and a Closing Ceremony speaker has addressed participants, the judges will announce the top three teams which will receive first, second, and third place. A People’s Choice award will be given to a project and team elected for its outstanding qualities by other Ideathon participants.</div>
